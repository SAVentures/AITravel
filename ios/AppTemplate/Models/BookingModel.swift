/*
 The two reference models for the Wallet feature:

 - `TripWalletModel`  — the container / list owner. A mutable list row at the wallet level;
   holds the ordered collection of bookings and exposes a lookup helper plus the orphan-
   placement write seams.

 - `BookingModel`     — the row. One booking entry. Holds the leaf value types directly
   (BookingType, BookingStatus, BookingDetailInfo?, AccessPass?) so only the mutated row
   is re-observed by SwiftUI.

 Both are `@MainActor @Observable final class` because both participate in list rendering and
 mutate in place (02-models §1.1). Neither is Codable — serialisation is the DTO layer's job
 (Task 2.2). Equality is identity-based; no value Equatable/Hashable.

 `restore(from: BookingDTO)` on BookingModel is the rollback seam: AppStore calls it after a
 failed optimistic write to revert the live reference in place (03-store §3). BookingDTO is
 defined in Task 2.2; this file forward-references it — the compiler will flag it until 2.2
 lands.

 Status is stored as seeded value data (OD-3 decision: deterministic, no live-clock derivation).
 Computing from simulatedNow + per-booking dates is a later upgrade.
